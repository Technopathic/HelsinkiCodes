## Activision Blizzard Lawsuit
Aside from their many game hits, Activision Blizzard has recently been slammed with numerous controversies and lawsuits in recent years. These range from mistreatment of employees, sexual harassment, and refusal to address these issues in a professional manner. The horrific mistreatment of women working for Activision Blizzard included denial for promotion, unwanted sexual advances, criticizing women of color, and many more displays of disgusting behavior.

It's difficult to talk about any news of Activision Blizzard without bringing up their toxic nature. Let's look towards the future and what this acquisition could mean for the company and Microsoft. In light of legal proceedings, it's more than likely no work has been done on already existing titles and many future titles have been indefinetly postponed. Granted, if the company does survive, Activision Blizzard, under Microsoft's leadership, will have to make drastic changes in their workplace environment in order to create a safe and inclusive studio.

## Microsoft Metaverse
Microsoft is no stranger to game development and is clearly seeking more opportunities in the gaming metaverse. “Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “We’re investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all.” Acquiring a multi-billion dollar company with nearly ten-thousand employees across the world will undoubtedly give them an advantage as many companies are turning to the metaverse.
