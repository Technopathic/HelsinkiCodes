I hope you're excited as I am for the Finnish Game Jam 2022 this very weekend! If you're not aware, game culture is so large here in Finland that we have our very own subset of the Global Game Jam, aptly named the "Finnish Game Jam". 

## What is a Game Jam?
A game jam is an event, in this case a 48-hour event, where teams and individuals attempt to create a game surrounding a particular theme. Large events, such as the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/faq"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Game Jam</a>, also have diversifiers, which are aspects you can add to your game to make them stand out more. These events are also typically sponsored and can be a lot of fun for the industry.

## Sounds like work with extra steps
Sure, there is work involved in creating a game. There are many individualistic reasons why people participate in game jams.

* Become a better game developer or designer
* Try something out of your comfort zone
* Work with people from other companies
* Share ideas and projects
* Challenge yourself
* Create an obscure game and not have to worry about marketability
* Competitiveness

Personally, I've enjoyed the Finnish Game Jam because there's so much to learn from the experienced game developers here. There's also something really pleasing about working among other teams, but everybody is working on something different (granted, many of the jam sites are remote).

In the past, I've seen game designers attempt to do development and developers attempt to be illustrators. This leads to hilarious results, but nevertheless allows for a shared perspective when making games. 

One of the cooler projects I've seen from last year was this one game made for the Vectrex and was possible to run on an emulator. It was wild because the Vectrex was a vector based game console from the 80s and it's unfathamable to think anybody would still develop a game for it.

While the Global Game Jam isn't really a competition, there are awards given out to games of notable games for best design, non-digital game, audio, use of theme, overall, and more. 

## The 2022 Programme
Last year, Finland produced nearly 200 games over the Game Jam weekend. This year's theme is "Duality" and we have 15 different jam sites with hybrid and remote participants. My own company will be participating in the game jam this weekend as well (I'll try to contribute where I can ☺️). I hope everyone will tune into the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/FinnishGameJam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FGJ Twitch channel</a>, as I will be one of the hosts for the Saturday evening slot. Below, you can find a link to the Finnish Game Jam schedule from the organizers.

And if you're participating in the FGJ 2022, I wish you the best of luck this weekend!
