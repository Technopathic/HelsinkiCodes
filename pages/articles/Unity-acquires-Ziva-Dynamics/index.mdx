Chances are if you've played a few banger games like Marvel's Spider-man: Miles Morales, Hellblade II, or seen films like Godzilla vs Kong, then you've witnessed the character creation software developed by Ziva Dynamics.

The Ziva team was co-founded by Academy Award-winner James Jacobs (CEO), a USC Viterbi School of Engineering professor Jernej Barbic (CTO), and Canadian businessman Chris Godsall. Their flagship software, Ziva VFX, is used to digitally replicate the physics and materials of soft tissue, such as muscles, fat, and skin, allowing artists to create some pretty life-like characters. 

Unity, the well-known video game engine creator has announced it's purchase of Ziva Dynamics in an effort to make digital character creation tools more accessible.

    Creating digital humans that meet the quality and natural dynamics needed to truly satisfy our minds can be a complicated and painful effort, requiring both expert knowledge and extreme perseverance.

In addition to the annoucement, both teams also revealed project Emma, which is powered by state-of-the-art machine learning and is running real-time in Unity. 

<Blockquote name="Unity">
Her model was trained with over 30 terabytes of unique 4D data using the ZRT Trainer, which enables her to emote over 72,000 trained shapes and achieve entirely novel face poses. This is deep tech for amazingly realistic animation and incredibly emotive performances; letting characters shine even in demanding real-time environments. And soon, it will be accessible to artists and creators of all levels.

This new level of digital design, interactivity, and accessibility for all levels of artists is no doubt thanks for the democratization of tools Unity has purchased within the past year. These include 3D data handling company Pixyz Software, environment developer SpeedTree, remote desktop streaming tool creator Parsec, VFX platform Weta Digital, and collaboration tool maker SyncSketch.
