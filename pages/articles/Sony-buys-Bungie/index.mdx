Earlier this month, Microsoft purchased Activision in a huge industry acquisition deal. This week, Sony bought Destiny 2 creator, Bungie, for $3.6 billion. 

If you're worried about exclusivity, Bungie will reportedly remain "an independent subsidiary" of Sony Interactive Entertainment, meaning they'll be able "to self-publish and reach players" however they see fit.

  This is an important step in our strategy to expand the reach of PlayStation to a much wider audience. We understand how vital Bungie's community is to the studio and look forward to supporting them as they remain independent and continue to grow.

It's crazy to think the long-time developers of the Halo series, a Microsoft Xbox / PC exclusive game, would be bought by one of Microsoft's largest competitor. Bungie had eventually became an independent studio, developing Destiny with Activision Blizzard (also now owned by Microsoft), and later Destiny 2 alone. 

There's quite a lot of speculation of why Sony would purchase Bungie and not lock in any exclusivity. One theory, based on Bungie's previous contracts, has been to retain creative control, while the parent company (Sony) has ownership of all IPs and revenue gained from Bungie's work. Of course, if Bungie doesn't perform, Sony can always sell their ownership. Granted, Destiny 2 has been doing quite well even without a large corporation behind it, so Sony should feel quite confident. 

The first month of 2022 has so far been a game industry acquisition roulette, there's no telling what other company might be bought by an even larger company. What's next? Remedy Entertainment is bought by Disney?
